# Frontend

Flutter-based frontend for blooming seasons gardens; works with the Clojure backend.

## Development

From this folder, run `flutter run --release`. (For development, leave out the release flag.) When prompted, choose Chrome (option 2 by default).

## Troubleshooting

- If imports fail with "target of URI does not exist", execute the "Dart: Restart Analysis Server" command
