# Frontend

Flutter-based frontend for the blooming seasons design studio; works with the Clojure backend.

## Development

In VSCode, run the debugger (F5 by default).
Changes should cause a reload automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- If imports fail with "target of URI does not exist", execute the "Dart: Restart Analysis Server" command
