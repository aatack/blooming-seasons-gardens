# Blooming Seasons Design Studio

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This should open a browser window running the app.
To access the electron interface, run:

```bash
npm run electron-dev
```

which opens an electron window running the local host address on which the app is running.
Changes to the source code should update that display live (upon saving).

## References

The initial project setup was done by following [a guide](https://medium.com/folkdevelopers/the-ultimate-guide-to-electron-with-react-8df8d73f4c97) and then removing all the boilerplate that wasn't strictly necessary.
