# Blooming Seasons Design Studio

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This should open a browser window running the app.
To access the electron interface, run:

```bash
npm run electron-dev
```

which opens an electron window running the local host address on which the app is running.
Changes to the source code should update that display live (upon saving).
